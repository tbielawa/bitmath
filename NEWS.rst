bitmath-1.3.1-1
***************

`bitmath-1.3.1-1
<https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/releases/tag/1.3.1.1>`__ was
published on 2016-07-17.

Changes
=======

**Added Functionality**

* New function: :func:`bitmath.parse_string_unsafe`, a less strict
  version of :func:`bitmath.parse_string`. Accepts inputs using
  *non-standard* prefix units (such as single-letter, or
  mis-capitalized units).

* Inspired by `@darkblaze69 <https://github.com/darkblaze69>`_'s
  request in `#60 "Problems in parse_string"
  <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/issues/60>`_.


Project
=======

**Ubuntu**

* Bitmath is now available for installation via Ubuntu Xenial, Wily,
  Vivid, Trusty, and Precise PPAs.

* Ubuntu builds inspired by `@hkraal <https://github.com/hkraal>`_
  reporting an `installation issue
  <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/issues/57>`_ on Ubuntu systems.


**Documentation**

* `Cleaned up a lot <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/issues/59>`_
  of broken or re-directing links using output from the Sphinx ``make
  linkcheck`` command.

Changes
=======

**Bug Fixes**

* Closed `GitHub Issue #55
  <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/issues/55>`_ "best_prefix for
  negative values". Now :func:`bitmath.best_prefix` returns correct
  prefix units for negative values. Thanks `mbdm
  <https://github.com/mbdm>`_!

published on 2015-11-30.

Changes
=======

**Added Functionality**

* New bitmath module function: :func:`bitmath.query_device_capacity`. Create
  :class:`bitmath.Byte` instances representing the capacity of a block
  device. Support is presently limited to Linux and Mac.

* The :func:`bitmath.parse_string` function now can parse 'octet'
  based units. Enhancement requested in `#53 parse french unit names
  <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/issues/53>`_ by `walidsa3d
  <https://github.com/walidsa3d>`_.

**Bug Fixes**

* `#49 <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/pull/49>`_ - Fix handling
  unicode input in the `bitmath.parse_string
  <https://bitmath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/module.html#bitmath-parse-string>`__
  function. Thanks `drewbrew <https://github.com/drewbrew>`_!

* `#50 <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/pull/50>`_ - Update the
  ``setup.py`` script to be python3.x compat. Thanks `ssut
  <https://github.com/ssut>`_!


Documentation
=============

* The project documentation is now installed along with the bitmath
  library in RPM packages.


Project
=======

**Fedora/EPEL**

Look for separate python3.x and python2.x packages coming soon to
`Fedora <https://getfedora.org/>`_ and `EPEL
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_. This is happening because of
the `initiative
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_Python_3_Porting_2015>`_ to update
the base Python implementation on Fedora to Python 3.x

* `BZ1282560 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1282560>`_
